Data Dictionaries
If you woud like the response documentation in Excel or CSV form, please download them from our public GitHub Reposiitory: Belvo Open Finance Data Dictionaries.

Our EXCEL and CSV files are additionally localized into Spanish and Portuguese (Brazil).

Environments
We currently offer two environments: sandbox and production.

Sandbox
Available for:

🟢 Aggregation and Enrichment
⚪️ Payment Initiation
Use our Sandbox environment to build your integration. We offer dummy data that mimics that of real-world use cases, which means you can test out all the endpoints, use the widget, and implement webhooks - just as you would with real-world data!

All you need to get started with the Sandbox environment is to get your API keys. We really recommend that you start creating your integration in this environment.

Production
Available for:

🟢 Aggregation and Enrichment
🟢 Payment Initiation
After you have tested your integration in the Sandbox environment and are ready to go live, you'll need to request access to our Production environment. After you request access, our Sales Team will get in contact with you to schedule a meeting just to ensure your needs are met, and then you'll just need to go through a certification process with one of our engineers to make sure that your integration is running optimally. To prepare for the certification meeting, just follow our Integration checklist.

Once your integration is certified, all you'll need to do is:

 Request Production API keys (and change your Sandbox API keys in the code to these new ones).
 Change the base URL that you make requests to from sandbox.belvo.com to api.belvo.com.
 If you're using webhooks, make sure to set a Production URL for your webhooks.
Response codes
We use the following HTTP status code in the response depending on the success or failure:

Status Code	Description
200	✅ Success - The content is available in the response body.
201	✅ Success - The content was created successfully on Belvo.
204	✅ Success - No content to return.
400	❌ Bad Request Error - Request returned an error, detail in the content.
401	❌ Unauthorized - The Belvo credentials provided are not valid.
404	❌ Not Found - The resource you try to access cannot be found.
405	❌ Method Not Allowed - The HTTP method you are using is not accepted for this resource.
408	❌ Request Timeout - The request timed out and was terminated by the server.
428	❌ MFA Token Required - MFA token was required by the institution to connect.
500	❌ Internal Server Error - The detail of the error is available in the response body.
Error handling
Belvo API errors are returned in JSON format. For example, an error might look like this:



[
    {
      "request_id": "a6e1c493d7a29d91aed4338e6fcf077d",
      "message": "This field is required.",
      "code": "required",
      "field": "link"
    }
]
Typically, an error response will have the following parameters:

request_id: a unique ID for the request, you should share it with the Belvo support team for investigations.
message: human-readable description of the error.
code: a unique code for the error. Check the table below to see how to handle each error code.
field (optional): The specific field in the request body that has an issue.
Request identifier
When you need help with a specific error, include the request identifier (request_id) in your message to the Belvo support team. This will speed up investigations and get you back up and running in no time at all.

Error codes and troubleshooting
For a full list of errors and how to troubleshoot them, please see our dedicated Error Handling article.

Retry policy
50x errors
Implement an automated exponential backoff of up to five retries. We recommend using a base interval of three seconds with a factor of two. For example, the first retry should be after three seconds, the second retry after six seconds (2 * 3), the third retry after 12 seconds (2 * 6), the fourth retry after 24 seconds (2 * 12), and the fifth retry after 48 seconds (2 * 24).

40x errors
You should not retry making requests if you receive a 40x response, as this is a client error.

The only exception is the “Too Many Sessions” error, as it means that your end-user is accessing the account from another browser at the same time. In this case, please implement the same retry policy as with 50x errors.

Deprecated fields
In our schema, you may see that a field has been marked as deprecated. This means that this field is no longer maintained by the Belvo team. You may still receive data for this field depending on the institution, however, you should not rely on this field.

OpenAPI: required and nullable fields
In our API specification, you'll see that some response parameters will have a required annotation. According to the OpenAPI specification, when a response parameter is marked as required, this means that the response key must be returned. However, the value of that response parameter can be null.

📘 Info

In short, any response parameter marked as required will be returned by our API, but the value can be set to null.

An account is the representation of a bank account inside a financial institution. A user can have one or more accounts in an institution.

For example, one user (or link) can have a checking account, several credit cards, and a loan account.

Querying for a user's account information is useful as you can get information regarding:

what types of accounts the user has.
the balance for each account (savings, checking, credit card, loan, and so on).
detailed information regarding their credit card spending.
the current situation of any loans they may have.

Payment Authorizations (Brazil)
Copy

A Payment Authorization is the consent that your user gives you to charge (debit money from) their accounts. You need to perform one Payment Authorization per ‘contract’ (for example, if your company does both electricity and water but they are billed separately, then you will create two separate Payment Authorizations).

Once the user confirms the authorization, you will need to listen for a a PAYMENT_AUTHORIZATION webhook with the status set to AUTHORIZED. Once you receive this webhook, the authorization process is complete, and you will be able to charge your user.

What is a charge?
A charge represents the individual payment (debit) that your customer will make.

Version Header
The Payment Authorization resource requires that you send through the X-Belvo-API-Resource-Version header set to Payments-BR.V2.
